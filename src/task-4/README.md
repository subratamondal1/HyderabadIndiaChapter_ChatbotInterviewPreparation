## Development

This section will guide you through the development process of the Chatbot for Interview Preparation using NLP.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Python, pip and poetry
- You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine. State which OS is supported/required.

### Developing

#### **Development Tasks:**

1. **User Introduction and Details Collection:**
   - Integrate a general-purpose LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5/GPT-4, Cohere, Google Palm API) for handling user greetings and basic conversation.
   - Implement logic for extracting relevant details from user input to personalize the interaction.

2. **Question Generation:**
   - Develop a specific LLM agent using technologies like RAG or ICL for generating interview questions based on user details.
   - Ensure the agent understands contextual information provided by the user and tailors questions accordingly.

3. **Interview Simulation:**
   - Build an LLM capable of conducting a conversational interview, simulating a realistic environment.
   - Incorporate logic to ask questions, understand, and evaluate user responses, providing a dynamic interview experience.

4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:**
   - Integrate Text-to-Speech functionality using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
   - Implement TTS for converting written text, including interview questions and feedback, into spoken words for an interactive experience.

5. **Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration:**
   - Implement Speech-to-Text capability using technologies like Sphinx or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
   - Enable the system to accurately convert spoken language into written text, facilitating analysis and feedback on user responses.

6. **Overall Evaluation and Feedback:**
   - Develop an LLM agent for evaluating user responses based on predefined criteria.
   - Implement logic to analyze answers in the context of interview performance, providing constructive feedback.

7. **Closing and Encouragement:**
   - Integrate a general-purpose LLM for delivering closing remarks, expressing gratitude, and offering encouragement.
   - Ensure the model provides positive and motivating language to conclude the interaction.

8. **Optional: Follow-up Actions:**
   - Develop an LLM capable of suggesting additional resources, practice sessions, or saving user progress.
   - Implement a recommendation system using the language model to provide relevant suggestions based on user performance.

9. **Optional: User Feedback Analysis:**
   - Integrate an LLM specialized in gathering user feedback.
   - Implement logic for sentiment analysis and feedback processing to make improvements based on user input.

10. **Testing and Iteration:**
    - Conduct thorough testing of the integrated system to ensure smooth and accurate functionality at each stage.
    - Gather user feedback during testing and iterate on the models and interactions for continuous improvement.
